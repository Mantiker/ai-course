    "## AI Risks Identification Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create an interactive and structured *AI Risks Identification Tool* that allows users to categorize the identified risks and provides a summary of the risks under each category. We'll use dictionaries and lists to organize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the descriptions of the functions which will be used in the AI Risks Identification Tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "`get_risks_and_categories` - This function asks users to input the appropriate category of the potential risks associated with the usage of AI in everyday life. It prompts the user to enter risks and their corresponding categories iteratively until all the elements from `risks_list` will be passed. The risks and categories (entered by the user) are stored in a list of lists, where each category is 0 element of inner list, and the corresponding risks is stored as a 1 element of inner list (eg. `[[category0, risk0], [category1, risk1]], ...`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parameters: This function takes `risks_list` parameter.\n",
    "- Returns: This function returns `risks_categories` - a list of lists  containing the risks and categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "`identify_risks()` - This function allows users to identify and categorize potential risks associated with the usage of AI in everyday life. The risks and categories are stored in a dictionary, where each category is a key, and the corresponding risks are stored in a list under that key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parameters: This function takes `risks_categories` parameter.\n",
    "- Returns: This function returns a dictionary containing the categorized risks. The keys of the dictionary are the categories, and the values are lists of risks associated with each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "`display_risks_summary(risks)` - This function displays a summary of the identified AI risks under each category. It takes the categorized risks dictionary as input and prints the risks in a user-friendly format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parameters: `risks (dict)` - A dictionary containing categorized risks. The keys are the categories, and the values are lists of risks associated with each category.\n",
    "- Returns: This function does not return any value. It simply prints the summary of identified AI risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `identify_risks()` function organizes the entered risks into a dictionary to keep track of the different risk categories. The `display_risks_summary()` function then takes this dictionary as input and presents a clear summary of the identified AI risks under each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions enable users to interactively explore and categorize AI risks, making it easier to comprehend the various challenges and concerns associated with the use of AI in everyday life.\n"
