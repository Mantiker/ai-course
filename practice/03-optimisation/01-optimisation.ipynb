Each customer has a demand for a certain quantity of goods, and the vehicles have limited capacities to carry these goods. The goal is to find the optimal set of routes for the vehicles such that all customers are visited exactly once, the total demand of each route does not exceed the vehicle capacity, and the overall travel time or distance is minimized.\n",

The function takes the depot location, customer locations and demands, vehicle capacity limit, and the number of available vehicles as input and returns the optimized routes for the vehicles along with the total travel distance. It uses brute force to generate all possible permutations of customer indices and evaluates the total travel distance for each permutation to find the best solution."
