# AI basics

**AI** is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans


### Types of AI
- Narrow AI (Weak AI) - for solving only particular type of tasks
- General AI (Strong AI) - for solving wide variaty types of tasks


### Algorithms types:
- determenistic - with the same output for the same input
- stochastic - with different output for the same input


### AI Techniques and Approaches:
- **Machine Learning** - learn from data and improve performance over time
  1) Supervised Learning - trained on labeled data, where the input-output pairs are provided
  2) Unsupervised Learning - unlabeled data and the algorithm aims to find patterns or structures within the data
  3) Reinforcement Learning - the agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions, encouraging it to learn optimal strategies
- **Deep learning** - a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
  1) Chatbots and Virtual Assistants
  2) Sentiment Analysis
  3) Language Translation
- **Computer Vision**
  1) Object Detection
  2) Facial Recognition
  3) Autonomous Vehicles
- **Robotics**
  1) Autonomous Robots
  2) Industrial Automation
  3) Social Robots
- **Expert Systems** - a class of AI programs designed to emulate the decision-making capabilities of human experts in specific domains
- **Knowledge Representation** - a fundamental aspect of AI, focused on representing and organizing knowledge in a way that machines can understand and use


### The AI Development Process
- Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Model Development and Training
- Model Evaluation and Fine-Tuning
- Deployment and Ongoing Maintenance
